            <p>
                With searchcode server you can search across any repository of code that has been added by your
                administrator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Type in anything you want to find and you will be presented with the results that match with the
                relevant lines highlighted.
                Searches can filtered down using the right filter panel. Suggested search terms are,
            <ul>
                <li>Function/Method names E.G. <a href="/?q=Format">Format</a>, <a href="/?q=re.compile">re.compile</a>
                </li>
                <li>Constant and variable names E.G. <a href="/?q=ERROR">ERROR</a>, <a href="/?q=username">username</a>
                </li>
                <li>Operations E.G. <a href="/?q=foreach">foreach</a>, <a href="/?q=while">while</a></li>
                <li>Security Flaws E.G. <a href="/?q=eval+%24_GET">eval $_GET</a></li>
                <li>Usage E.G. <a href="/?q=import+flash.display.Sprite%3B">import flash.display.Sprite;</a></li>
                <li>Special Chracters E.G. <a href="/?q=%2B">+</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>
            <p>
                Type any term you want to search for in the search box and press the enter key. Generally best results
                can be
                gained by searching for terms that you expect to be close to each other on the same line.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following search operators are supported.

            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                <dt>AND</dt>
                <dd>Match where documents contain terms on both sides of the operator. E.G. <a
                            href="/?q=test%20AND%20import">test AND import</a></dd>
                <dt>OR</dt>
                <dd>Match where documents contain terms on either side of the operator. E.G. <a
                            href="/?q=test%20OR%20import">test OR import</a></dd>
                <dt>NOT</dt>
                <dd>Match where documents do not contain terms on the right hand side of the operator. E.G. <a
                            href="/?q=test%20NOT%20import">test NOT import</a></dd>
                <dt>( )</dt>
                <dd>Group terms. Allows creation of exclusive matches. E.G. <a
                            href="/?q=(test%20OR%20import)%20AND%20other">(test OR import) AND other</a></dd>
                <dt>*</dt>
                <dd>Wildcard. Only applies at end of a query. E.G. <a href="/?q=test*">test*</a></dd>
            </dl>

            An example using all of the above would be <a
                    href="/?q=(mkdir%20NOT%20sphinx*)%20OR%20(php%20AND%20print*)">(mkdir NOT sphinx*) OR (php AND
                print*)</a>
            This will search for documents containing mkdir but not starting with sphinx or documents containing php and
            containing terms starting with print.
            Operators must be in upper case where show or they will be treated as part of the query itself. I.E. to
            match on documents containing <a href="/?q=and">and</a> search for and lowercase.
            <br/><br/>
            Other characters are treated as part of the search itself. This means that a search for something such as <a
                    href="/?q=i%2B%2B%3B">i++;</a> is
            not only a legal search it is likely to return results for most code bases.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a search does not return the results you are expecting or no results at all consider rewriting the
                query.
                For example searching for <strong>Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1")</strong> could be turned
                into a
                looser query by searching for <strong>Arrays.asList</strong> or <strong>Arrays asList</strong>. Another
                example would be <strong>EMAIL_ADDRESS_REGEX</strong> for
                <strong>email address regex</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To view the full file that is returned click on the name of the file, or click on any line to be taken
                to that line.
                Syntax highlighting is enabled for all files less than 1000 lines in length.
            </p>

            <h3 id="literal">Literal Search</h3>
            <p>
                You can perform a literal search against the index by enabling literal search. To do so check the box
                "Literal Search" in the Search Options
                panel of the search result page. This search includes all the standard searches performed by <a
                        href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/5_2_1/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html">Lucene</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Wildcard Searches</h4>
            <p>Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase
                queries).</p>
            <p>To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.</p>
            <p>To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.</p>
            <p>The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced.
                For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search:
            <pre class="code">te?t</pre>
            </p>
            <p>Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test,
                tests or tester, you can use the search:
            <pre class="code">test*</pre>
            </p>
            <p>You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.
            <pre class="code">te*t</pre>
            </p>
            <p>Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.</p>

            <h4>Regular Expression Searches</h4>
            <p>Lucene supports regular expression searches matching a pattern between forward slashes "/". For example
                to find documents containing "moat" or "boat":
            <pre class="code">/[mb]oat/</pre>
            </p>


            <h4>Fuzzy Searches</h4>
            <p>Lucene supports fuzzy searches based on Damerau-Levenshtein Distance. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde,
                "~", symbol at the end of a Single word Term. For example to search for a term similar in spelling to
                "roam" use the fuzzy search:
            <pre class="code">roam~</pre>
            </p>
            <p>This search will find terms like foam and roams.</p>
            <p>An additional (optional) parameter can specify the maximum number of edits allowed. The value is between
                0 and 2, For example:
            <pre class="code">roam~1</pre>
            </p>
            <p>The default that is used if the parameter is not given is 2 edit distances.</p>

            <h4>Proximity Searches</h4>
            <p>Lucene supports finding words are a within a specific distance away. To do a proximity search use the
                tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example to search for a "apache" and "jakarta" within 10
                words of each other in a document use the search:
            </p>
            <pre class="code">"jakarta apache"~10</pre>

            <p>
                The following fields are supported. All spaces and / characters are replaced with _
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                <dt>fn</dt>
                <dd>File name. E.G. fn:search*</dd>
                <dt>rn</dt>
                <dd>Repository name. E.G. rn:searchcode*</dd>
                <dt>ln</dt>
                <dd>Language name. E.G. ln:java OR ln:bourne_again_shell</dd>
                <dt>on</dt>
                <dd>Owner name. E.G. on:ben</dd>
                <dt>fl</dt>
                <dd>File location. E.G. fl:src*</dd>
            </dl>
            </p>

            <h3 id="html">HTML Only</h3>
            <p>
                You can search using a pure HTML interface (no javascript) <a href="/html/">by clicking here</a>. Note
                that this page generally
                lags behind the regular interface in functionality.
            </p>

            <h3 id="filters">Filters</h3>
            <p>
                Any search can be filtered down to a specific repository, source, identified language or code owner
                using the refinement options.
                Select one or multiple repositories, sources, languages or owners and click the "Filter Selected or
                "refine search" button to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that in the case that a filter has only a single option for source it will not display any option
                to filter. This is to avoid cluttering the display were you have only a single source to search from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Filters on the normal interface persist between searches. This allows you to select a specific
                repository or language and continue searching. To clear applied filters uncheck the filters indivudually
                and click on "Filter Selected". You can also click "Clear Filters" button to clear all active filters.
                The HTML only page filters are cleared between every new search.
            </p>

            <h3 id="owners">Code Owners</h3>
            <p>
                The owner of any piece of code is determined differently between source control systems. See below for
                details.
            </p>
            <p>
                GIT owners are determined by counting the number of lines edited by each user. This is then weighted
                against the last commit time. For example, Bob added a file of 100 lines in length 1 year ago.
                Mary modified 30 lines of the file last week. In this situation Mary would be marked as the owner as she
                has modified
                enough of the file and recently enough to be more familiar with it than Bob would be. If she has only
                modified a single
                line however Bob would still be marked as the owner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name is taken based on the git config user.name setting attached to the user in commits.
            </p>
            <p>
                SVN owners are determined by looking at the last user to change the file. For example, Bob edited a
                single line in a file with 100 lines. Bob will be
                considered the owner even if Mary edited the other 99 previously.
            </p>


            <h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
            <p>Source code is complex to search. As such the following restrictions currently apply
            <ul>
                <li>Relevant lines in the search display favor lines in the beginning of file however there may be other
                    matching lines within the file. By default searchcode will only inspect the first 10000 lines for
                    matches when serving results.
                </li>
                <li>The following characters are not indexed and will be ignored from searches <strong>< > ) ( [ ] |
                        =</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Where possible if there are no matches searchcode server will attempt to suggest an alternate search
                    which is more likely to produce results.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 id="estimatedcost">Estimated Cost</h3>
            <p>The estimated cost for any file or project is created using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                                                                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO">Basic
                    COCOMO</a>
                algorithmic software cost estimation model. The cost reflected includes design, coding, testing,
                documentation for both
                developers and users, equipment, buildings etc... which can result in a higher estimate than would be
                expected. Generally
                consider this the cost of developing the code, and not what it is "worth".
                It is based on an average salary of $56,000 per year but this value can be changed by the system
                administrator if
                the values appear to be too out of expectation.</p>


            <h3 id="api">API</h3>
            <p>API endpoints offered by your searchcode server instance are described below. Note that some require API
                authentication
                which will also be covered.</p>
            <p>
            <h4>API Authentication</h4>
            API authentication is done through the use of shared secret key HMAC generation. If enabled you will be
            required to sign
            the arguments sent to the API endpoint as detailed. Ask your administrator for a public and private key to
            be generated for you
            if you require access to the API.
            <br><br>
            To sign a request see the below examples in Python demonstrating how to perform all repository API calls.
            The most important thing to note is that parameter order is important. All API endpoints will list the order
            that parameters should have passed in. The below code is has no license and is released as public domain.
            The second
            example is identical to the first but performs the signing using SHA512 for greater security.<br/><br/>

            <h4>Repository API (secured)</h4>
            The repository API allows you to list, add/update and delete repositories that are currently being indexed
            within your searchcode server instance. All calls to the repository API methods are secured if the
            appropiate property has been set by your administrator.

            <h5>Endpoint List All Repositories</h5>
            <pre>/api/repo/list/</pre>
            <p>Some repositories returned by this endpoint may be queued for deletion. They will continue to appear in

            <h2>Administration</h2>
            <p>
                searchcode server is designed to require as little maintenance as possible and look after itself once
                setup and
                repositories are indexed. However it can be tuned using the settings mentioned below in the
                searchcode.properties
                file or through the <a href="/admin/settings/">admin settings page</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 id="web-server">Web Server</h3>

            <p>searchcode server uses the high performance jetty web server. It should perform well even with thousands
                of requests
                as a front facing solution. If a reverse proxy solution is required there is no need to configure static
                assets, simply
                configure all requests to pass back to searchcode server. You should also set the config property
                only_localhost to true
                in this case.</p>

            <h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

            <p>There are two properties files in the base directory of searchcode server, searchcode.properties and
                quartz.properties.</p>

            <p>
                The searchcode.properties file in the base directory is a simple text file that can be used to configure
                aspects of searchcode server. By default
                it is setup using suggested defaults. <b>It is important to note that the password to administer your
                    server is located
                    in this file</b>.
                To apply changes, modify the file as required then restart searchcode. All slashes used in the
                properties file should be forward not backwards. I.E. Unix style not Windows.

            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                <dt id="password">password</dt>
                <dd>The password used to login to the admin section. <strong>It is suggested that this is

                </dd>
                <dt>server_port</dt>

                By default searchcode spawns 10 background threads which are used for repository processing and internal
                processing logic. By itself searchcode uses 5 threads
                by itself leaving over 5 for background repository processing tasks. If you adjust the number of
                repository processors higher then you should increase the value for

            <h3 id="apikeys">API Keys</h3>

            <p>
                The api key page is used to maintain keys used for authenticated API requests. This page is only
                relevant if you firstly
                enble the API through properties and then enable authenticated API reqeusts as well. To generate a key
                click the "Generate New API Key"
                button. A new API key will be created and appear at the bottom of the list. The key consists of two
                parts. The first portion is the public
                key which is used to identify who is making the request to the API. The second is the private key and
                should be shared only with the consuming
                application. This key is used to sign the request. To delete a key click the delete button next to the
                key you wish to remove. Generally it is
                considered good practice to create individual keys for each application using the API.
            </p>

            <h3 id="backups">Backups</h3>
            <p>Generally searchcode server should only need the <b>searchcode.properties</b> and
                <b>searchcode.sqlite</b> files to be backed up.
                However where many repositories are indexed or when connectivity to source control can be problematic
                you may want to back up
                the index and repo directories and their contents.</p>

            <h3 id="recovery">Recovery / Restore</h3>
            <p>Assuming you want to recover searchcode you will need to install the application sources. Then copy a
                backup of the
                <b>searchcode.sqlite</b> and <b>searchcode.properties</b> files into the same directory. When started
                searchcode will
                analyse the code and rebuild the index. This process will take longer for setups that contain many or
                large repositories.
                If faster restores are required restore the index and repo directories as well.</p>

            <h3 id="repositories">Repositories</h3>
            <p>
                To index a repository browse to the <a href="/admin/">admin</a> page. Enter a repository name and url
                for publicly
                available repositories and for private a username and password for a user with enough access to checkout
                a copy
                of the repository. Repo Source should be a URL that relates to the repository (but can be anything) and
                will appear
                as a link on the code pages.
                When done click "Add Repo". The repository will be downloaded and indexed as soon as any other
                indexing operations are finished. Note that repository names cannot include a space, and any spaces will
                be replaced
                with a hyphen character.

                on the local machine such as <code>/opt/projects</code> Note that searchcode server needs permission to
                read the directory, subdirectories and contents of all files otherwise it will crash out with a
                AccessDeniedException in the logs. There are a few things to note
            <ul>
                <li>You can index any directory on the machine that searchcode server has permissions to read from.</li>
                <li>It is inadvisable to store the file repository in the same location as the property
                    repository_location as it will be removed if a full rebuild operation is triggered.
                </li>
                <li>Very large directories will need a lot of RAM to index, so consider breaking them up if possible to
                    multiple sub-directories to index.
                </li>
                <li>If you index the same file in the same path twice only a single result will appear in the results,
                    however deleting may remove the "wrong" file from the index. Try to avoid indexing the same path
                    where possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To delete a repository click the delete button at the end of the repository list. This will remove all
                copies of code
                from disk (not for file repositories however) and the index. This action is not reversible. To undo the
                operation add the repository again. Note that all delete operations are queued and it may take several
                minutes for the repository to be removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Updating the details of a repository will require you to delete the repository, wait for the delete
                operation to finish and add it again with the new details.
            </p>

            <p>To quickly add a large amount of repositories use the <a href="/admin/bulk/">bulk admin</a> page. This
                page will only
                allow the adding of repositories using a CSV format with one repository per line. Use the values git,
                svn or file for the choice of repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                The format for adding follows.<br><br>
                <code>reponame,scm,gitrepolocation,username,password,repourl,branch</code><br><br>

                For example a public repository which does not require username or password<br><br>

                <code>phindex,git,https://github.com/boyter/Phindex.git,,,https://github.com/boyter/Phindex,master</code>
                <small>*</small>
                <br><br>

                For example a private repository which requires a username and password<br><br>

                <code>searchcode,git,https://searchcode@bitbucket.org/searchcode/hosting.git,myusername,mypassword,https://searchcode@bitbucket.org/searchcode/,master</code><br><br>

                <small>* This is a real repository can can be indexed. Copy paste into the bulk admin page to test.

            <h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
            <p>
                <b>A repository is not being indexed?</b><br/>
                Check the console output, you should see something similar to<br/>
            <pre>ERROR - caught a class org.eclipse.jgit.api.errors.TransportException with message: https://username@bitbucket.org/username/myrepo.git: not authorized</pre>
            <br/>
            This means your username or password for the repository is invalid. Try pulling a copy down locally and
            replacing the credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A file in a repository is not being indexed?</b><br/>
                Files with an average file line length >= 255 are considered minified and will not be indexed. Files
                that are considered binary will also not be indexed. You should get a message like the ones below on the
                console saying as such when trying to index the file.<br/>
            <pre>Appears to be minified will not index FILENAME</pre>
            <pre>Appears to be binary will not index FILENAME</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A repository is not being indexed on Windows</b><br/>
                There are reserved file names on Windows such as CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6,
                COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.
                If a repository created on another OS contains one of these filenames it is likely that the attempt to
                clone or checkout will fail. Generally
                it is better to deploy searchcode server on a Unix style OS to avoid this problem. If you are only going
                to index repositories that
                were created using Windows then Windows is still a valid choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>OutOfMemoryError</b><br/>
                If you are getting the classic java out of memory error such as <br/>
            <pre>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</pre>
            <br/>
            There are a few things you can do. Try each one individually with a restart of your searchcode server
            instance.

            <ol>
                <li>Upgrade the amount of system RAM available on the host system.</li>
                <li>Edit the searchcode-server.sh or searchcode-server.bat file and add the Xmx and Xms arguments.</li>
                <li>Install git and set the searchcode.properties property git_binary_path to the path of your git
                    binary and set use_system_git to true.
                </li>
                <li>Lower the value of max_document_queue_size.</li>
                <li>Lower the value of max_file_line_depth to be less than the expected length of any file you need to
                    search.
                </li>
                <li>Set the searchcode.properties property low_memory to true and restart your instance. This should be
                    method of last resort as it will lower memory usage with the impact of less indexing performance.
                </li>
                <li>Set the searchcode.properties property spelling_corrector_size to a lower number such as 1000.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>java.io.IOException: Too many open files</b><br/>
                This issue typically occurs on Unix/Linux servers with a low ulimit.
                If you are getting errors like the above you may need to change your ulimit to a higher number as the
                default
                of 1024 for most systems can be too low.<br/>
                Also consider lowering the values for number_git_processors, number_svn_processors and
                number_file_processors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException</b><br/>
                This is usually caused when using the filepath indexing. Usually it means that the user running
                searchcode server does not have the required permissions to read from the path selection. You will need
                to set the permissions so that searchcode server has full read rights on the directory. Otherwise it can
                be cause if the index or repo directories have been denied to searchcode server which requires full read
                write delete permissions for these directories.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How do I index code in Perforce/BitKeeper/Fossil</b><br/>
                You can index code in unsupported repositories by checking out a copy of the repository on disk and
                adding a <a href="#filerepositories">file repository</a> which is pointed at this location. Suggested
                methods to keep it in sync would be setting up a cron job or scheduled task to constantly update the
                repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Odd Results</b><br/>
                If you have had an instance that has been running for a long time or that has stopped and started
                without notice
                the index may need to rebuilt. Click the "Recrawl & Rebuild Indexes" button in the admin pages. This
                will clear
                the repository and index directories and rebuild everything from scratch which should resolve the issue.
                Note that
                this process may take some time if you have a lot of repositories or very large ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Help! Nothing is working!</b><br/>
                Its possible that you may enter a state where nothing is working. In this case save the console output
                and try
                restarting searchcode. This may resolve the issue. If not, try stopping searchcode and deleting the
                index and repo directories.
                This will force searchcode server to re-download and re-index. If all else fails contact support.
