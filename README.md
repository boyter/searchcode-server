What is it?
-----------
searchcode server is a powerful code search engine with a sleak web user interface.

searchcode server works in tandem with your source control system, indexing thousands of repositories 
and files allowing you and your developers to quickly find and reuse code across teams.

See https://searchcode.com/product/ for more details

Support
-------
If you are building from source then you get no support and must work within the restrictions specified of the
fair source licence (see LICENSE.txt for details). To purchase support see 
https://searchcode.com/product/#downloadlinks

Submissions/Pull Requests
-------------------------
If you would like to submit code to be integrated into searchcode server please specifyc that it is dual licenced under Apache Public License v2 and GPL v3. This allows it to be pulled in directly without having to worry about licencing issues in the future.

To Build
--------
To build searchcode server you need to have any Windows, Linux or OSX machine with Java 8 installed and
maven setup. Idealy you want Python and Python Fabric installed as well but it is not a requirement.

To test the application you can either run "mvn test" or "fab test". To build a full release IE ready
for production you should run "fab build_release" which will test compile and build a release into
the release folder and produce the file "searchcode-server.tar.gz" which is a ready to deploy release.

If you want to simply test and run then you can run "fab run" however this will be default build a package
and run that. To run quickly just open in your IDE of choice and start running App.java


To Run
------

To run searchcode server you will need to have any Windows, Linux or OSX machine with Java 8 installed.
Testing and packaging was done using the below version.

java version "1.8.0_65"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)

Uncompress the file you have downloaded to a directory where you want to run searchcode server.
This directory should have more disk space than the size of the repositories you want to index.

Once unpacked assuming that java is in your path (check with the command java -version) you should be able to run
searchcode with the following command for Linux/OSX/BSD

./searchcode-server.sh

or for Windows

searchcode-server.bat

After a few moments searchcode server should be ready to run. By default it will be running on port 8080.
To connect to it enter the following in the browser,

http://SERVER_IP:8080

Be sure to replace SERVER_IP with the ip address if your server or localhost if running locally.
If you see a page with a search bar then everything is fine.

For further control you may want to edit the above files and include the java -Xmx arguement to specify the
amount of RAM to use or any other java option you wish to pass in.

To administer your searchcode server instance you need to click on the Admin link in the top right.
Enter the default password Adm1n234 (change this via the properties file)
to add git repositories. If you need help check the documentation page (link at the bottom
of every page).

Upgrades
--------

To upgrade your current instance of searchcode perform the following steps.

* Stop your current instance of searchcode server
* Make a backup copy of your current instances searchcode.properties and searchcode.sqlite files.
* Uncompress the package to a new directory.
* You can either
    * Copy the uncompressed files over your current instance overwriting if prompted.
    * Copy the directory dependancy-jars and all contents overwriting your current
    * Copy the following files searchcode-1.3.1.jar searchcode-server.bar and searchcode-server.sh to your instance directory
* Start your instance again
* Login to the admin screen and click the "Recrawl & Rebuild Indexes" button

It is also worth comparing your searchcode.properties file to the new one (or the documentation page) as there may be new configuration that you can use. Also be sure to check the settings page as there is likely to be new settings you can use.
